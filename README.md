# AriaControl
ARIA Control JavaScript Library

This libraries purpose is to automatically inject the necessary tags and commands to the users mark-up, so that it meets the standards as much as possible. There are also commands for the users to inject the methods on to specific parts if the library does not get them automatically. Also the automatic functionality can be turned off if only partly needed.

Here are some helpful links about ARIA to help understand the tags and their values.
